# Sharesquare - Expense Split Calculator

Sharesquare is a simple web app that helps you split bills among friends, including tax and tip calculations, with sharable results. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, itâ€™s lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Features
- Input total bill amount, tax rate, tip percentage, and number of people.
- Calculates the total bill including tax and tip.
- Splits the bill evenly among the specified number of people.
- Share the results via the Web Share API or by copying to the clipboard.
- Responsive design with a clean, modern UI using a custom color scheme (#584655, #EDCE8E, #FCBC46, #F97D4F).


## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Steps to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sharesquare.git
   cd Sharesquare
   ```
2. **Open the App**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser. Since the app uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no server is required.
   - Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., with VS Code's Live Server extension) for a better development experience.


### Customization
- **Colors**: Modify the `styles.css` file to change the color scheme. The current colors are:
  - Background: #EDCE8E (light teal)
  - Buttons: #F97D4F (orange)
  - Text/Accents: #584655 (dark purple)
  - Result Section: #FCBC46 (yellow-orange)
- **Features**: Add more features (e.g., uneven splitting, saving results) by extending `script.js`.
